    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial intelligence can be found in various computer and web-based applications. Even a simple Google search utilises AI to an extent. Other everyday uses of AI range from autocorrect and e-payments to facial recognition and other biometrics, such as fingerprint scanners (Reeves, 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strengths and Limitations of Artificial Intelligence\n",
    "\n",
    "There are undoubtedly many benefits to AI in today's world. However, like anything, there are also limitations to its application, and several risk factors (Kumar, 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strengths of AI\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strength 1: Reduction of Human Error\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike humans, who make mistakes from time to time, computer systems do not make mistakes if they are programmed correctly. The AI system's decisions are solely based on previously gathered information and the application of a set of algorithms, reducing error and reaching a more accurate conclusion (Kumar, 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strength 2: Reduction of Risk\n",
    "\n",
    "Humans are limited in what they can or can not do when it comes to risky undertakings, such as the defusing of bombs or mining. AI robots can be deployed in such risky environments to mitigate the risk to human life (Kumar, 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, at the time of the Chernobyl explosion, there were no AI agents to control the ensuing fire. It was difficult for humans to contain because on going too close, a fatal dose of radiation would be received. It is in these types of situation where AI robots could intervene in future (Kumar, 2019)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strength 3: Repetitive or Tiring Jobs\n",
    "\n",
    "AI agents can be deployed to perform menial, repetitive, or tiring jobs in the place of humans. Unlike humans, machines do not get bored, distracted, or tired if working for countless hours consecutively. They also think faster than humans and can perform various tasks at the same time, making them perfect for carrying out monotonous tasks (DataFlair, 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strength 4: Daily Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "AI has made many areas of our daily lives easier. Applications such as Google search, or digital assistants such as Apple's Siri, can be used to access information both quickly and easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if looking for the fastest way to get from one particular place to another, one can simply ask their digital assistant of choice and it will pull up a map with directions, estimated travel time, and even traffic conditions if applicable (Kumar, 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations of AI\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are many negative aspects to the increasing use of artificial intelligence. Fears have arisen in areas such as facial recognition, unemployment, and lack of emotion and creativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitation 1: Ethics\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain AI applications, such as that of facial recognition, must be monitored to ensure they are not being misused, intentionally or not. A facial recognition device must be developed so that it prevents or minimises bias towards any person or group based on qualities such as race, gender, or deformities (Joshi, 2021). Facial recognition systems must also not be used to monitor any person or group, unless authorised to do so by a decisive governing body. Doing so is a violation of the victims' human rights and freedom (Joshi, 2021).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitation 2: Unemployment\n",
    "\n",
    "There are fears that the increase in sophisticated AI systems could be used to replace humans completely in certain positions, causing widespread unemployment. AI is already replacing minimally-qualified individuals in certain areas, particularly those involving repetitive tasks (Kumar, 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitation 3: Lack of Emotion and/or Creativity\n",
    "\n",
    "Machines can not possess emotions and moral values. As such, they don't have the capacity to know what is ethical and/or legal and can not be completely trusted in their judgement (DataFlair, 2018). They also do not possess the capacity to think outside the box for creative problem-solving; they can only perform actions they are programmed to do (DataFlair, 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommender Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "A common application of AI encountered in daily life is that of recommender systems. Recommender systems are everywhere - video sites such as YouTube and Netflix, music services such as Spotify, even Amazon, utilise these systems to recommend relevant content to their users.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Recommender System?\n",
    "\n",
    "A recommender system is defined as an information filtering system that personalises the information fed to a user based on their interests, previous interactions, and relevance (Sharma, 2019). There are two types of recommender system: content-based and collaborative.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Content-based Recommender Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Content-based recommender systems rely on finding similarities between the features of items. For example, if a user liked a particular movie, a content-based recommender system will recommend movies with similar plots, themes, or actors. This works in the following manner:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each item has its own item profile, detailing its properties.\n",
    "- Each property is listed in a table.\n",
    "- The features of each item are compared to find matches in content, and a similarity score is collected.\n",
    "- The highest scoring match will be provided to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that this method relies on the features of an item exclusively - it does not utilise user preferences (Kirzhner, 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Collaborative Recommender Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative recommender systems rely not on the features of each item, but how other users responded to them. To create such a system, a different approach must be taken:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A user table is created, listing various rated items that they liked.\n",
    "- A prediction is made based on what the user may like, based on the behaviour and choices of similar users.\n",
    "- The list is matched to users who chose the same items.\n",
    "- All of this information is taken in and a similarity score will be recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "The collaborative method only works, however, if there is sufficient data provided beforehand to make recommendations. The more data there is available, the better the recommendations will be (Kirzhner, 2018)."
